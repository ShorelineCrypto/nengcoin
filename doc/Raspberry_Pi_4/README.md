Thought this might be a useful script for people, works on Pi and Userland should work on any Linux build really.

Its a send2wallet script....
Put the absolute path to your *coind wallets in
Put your reserve wallet addresses in

Then you simply ./send2wallet.sh and it goes, makes handling many miners much easier!
send2wallet script - send the balance of your miner to your reserve wallet
