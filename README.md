 - v2.2.0-1.11.x Reverse 51% attack on SXC. cheetah diff rise 5% 
 - v2.3.0-1.12.x Future timestamp 30 seconds rule, cheetah diff drop 5%, 3 CSV BIPs enabled, Segwit BIPs Disabled

Current full version name: "v2.3.0_randomSpike-1.12.x"
Note: All users/miners are recommended to use v2.3.0.  Solo miners on USB ASIC/ASIC are no longer recommended to use v1.12.1 because of soft forks enforcement.
Because now v2.3.0 are built with static linked wallet, macOS are fully supported (x86_64 wallet, but should work too for M1 chip)
